#BeepBeep v0.3
#Console music keyboard based on the beep command.

>>Instructions:
  -Install 'beep' first (option 3, "Install beep")*
  -Make sure you have a buzzer (You can test your system with option 2, "Test system")
  -Press 1 ("Initialize keyboard"). You will enter keyboard mode. 
  -Pressing q-u and a-e (Colemak) will generate notes in the 4th octave
  
  Recording:
  -Recording is turned on/off in the menu
    When recording is on, the script saves the generated notes in a text file in your home dir (~/BeepBeep)
    The file contains one note per line
    If a file is already present, a session separator line is inserted before writing any note on it
    Session separator lines are written even if no keys are pressed in the session

  *The install command uses apt-get. If your distro doesn't use apt-get, install beep manually.
  
>>List of files:

  main.sh		- The actual script.
  readme		- this

>>TO-DO:

  1) Add octaves
  2) Add pitch control
  3) Multiple layout support without using multiple scripts
  4) Playback of recorded files
  5) Detect OS and modify the install script so it works on non-debian distros.
